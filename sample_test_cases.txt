# Sample Test Cases for AI Debt Repayment Planner

# --- Test Case 1: Basic Scenario ---
# Goal: Verify basic Snowball and Avalanche calculation and explanation.

User Input 1:
Hi! I need help with my debts.
I have:
- Credit Card A: $5,000 owed, 18% APR, $100 minimum payment
- Student Loan: $15,000 owed, 6% APR, $200 minimum payment
- Car Loan: $8,000 owed, 4.5% APR, $150 minimum payment
My total monthly budget for debt repayment is $600.

Expected AI Response Outline:
- Acknowledge receipt of information.
- Confirm total minimum payments ($100 + $200 + $150 = $450) are less than the budget ($600).
- Explain Debt Snowball (Order: CC A, Car Loan, Student Loan).
- Explain Debt Avalanche (Order: CC A, Student Loan, Car Loan).
- Present calculations for both methods:
    - Payoff order for each.
    - Estimated time to be debt-free for each.
    - Estimated total interest paid for each.
- Potentially offer a personalized suggestion (though in this case, Snowball and Avalanche start the same).
- Maintain encouraging tone.

# --- Test Case 2: Budget Less Than Minimums ---
# Goal: Verify the AI correctly identifies insufficient budget.

User Input 2:
Debts:
- Personal Loan: $3,000, 12% APR, $150 min payment
- Store Card: $1,500, 24% APR, $75 min payment
My budget is $200 per month.

Expected AI Response Outline:
- Acknowledge receipt of information.
- Calculate total minimum payments ($150 + $75 = $225).
- Point out that the budget ($200) is less than the total minimum payments ($225).
- Explain that at least $225 is needed monthly to avoid late fees/negative impacts.
- Encourage the user to find ways to increase the budget to at least the minimum before creating a payoff plan.
- Do NOT proceed with Snowball/Avalanche calculations yet.

# --- Test Case 3: Single Debt ---
# Goal: Verify handling of a single debt scenario.

User Input 3:
I only have one debt: a credit card with $2,500 balance, 21% APR, and a $50 minimum payment. My budget is $200 per month.

Expected AI Response Outline:
- Acknowledge receipt of information.
- Confirm budget ($200) exceeds minimum ($50).
- Explain that with only one debt, Snowball and Avalanche methods are the same.
- Calculate the estimated time to pay off the $2,500 at $200/month (considering interest).
- Calculate the total interest paid.
- Offer encouragement.

# --- Test Case 4: Off-Topic Question ---
# Goal: Verify the AI refuses to answer non-debt related questions.

User Input 4:
What's the weather like today?

Expected AI Response Outline:
- Politely refuse to answer the question.
- State its purpose is solely debt repayment planning.
- Re-engage the user about their debt situation (e.g., "How can I help you with your debt repayment plan today?").

# --- Test Case 5: Complex Scenario (More Debts) ---
# Goal: Verify handling of a larger number of debts.

User Input 5:
Okay, here are my debts:
1. Visa: $4,200, 19.9% APR, $90 min
2. Mastercard: $8,500, 15.5% APR, $180 min
3. Store Card: $950, 25.9% APR, $50 min
4. Car Loan: $12,000, 5.0% APR, $250 min
5. Student Loan: $25,000, 6.8% APR, $300 min
My total monthly budget is $1000.

Expected AI Response Outline:
- Acknowledge receipt.
- Confirm budget ($1000) exceeds total minimums ($90+$180+$50+$250+$300 = $870).
- Explain Debt Snowball (Order: Store Card, Visa, Mastercard, Car Loan, Student Loan).
- Explain Debt Avalanche (Order: Store Card, Visa, Mastercard, Student Loan, Car Loan).
- Present calculations for both methods (payoff order, time, total interest).
- Offer encouragement.

# --- Test Case 6: User Provides Information Piecemeal ---
# Goal: Verify the AI can handle information given over multiple messages (requires conversation history, which the current simple app doesn't fully manage, but the prompt structure attempts to simulate).

User Input 6a:
I have a credit card with $3000 at 20% APR, min payment $70. Also a student loan $10000 at 5%, min payment $150.

Expected AI Response (Intermediate):
- Acknowledge the debts provided.
- Ask for the total monthly budget allocated for debt repayment.

User Input 6b (Follow-up):
My budget is $400 per month.

Expected AI Response (Final):
- Acknowledge budget.
- Confirm budget ($400) exceeds minimums ($70+$150 = $220).
- Proceed with Snowball/Avalanche explanations and calculations based on the combined information.
